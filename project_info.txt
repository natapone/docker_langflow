# Langflow Docker Setup

## Project Overview
This project provides a Docker Compose configuration for running Langflow locally on a MacBook Pro. Langflow is a UI for LangChain, enabling users to create and prototype LLM applications visually.

## Project Structure
- `docker-compose.yml`: Main configuration file for Docker services
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables file
- `README.md`: Instructions for using the Docker setup
- `custom_components/`: Directory for custom Langflow components
- `project_info.txt`: This file, containing project documentation

## Requirements
- Docker Desktop for Mac
- At least 4GB of free RAM
- At least 10GB of free disk space

## Configuration
The Docker Compose setup includes:
1. Langflow service using the official `langflowai/langflow:latest` image
2. PostgreSQL database for persistence
3. Docker volumes for data storage with proper permissions
4. Support for custom components
5. Volume initialization service to ensure proper permissions

## Usage
1. Create required directories: `mkdir -p custom_components`
2. Start services: `docker compose up -d`
3. Access Langflow at: http://localhost:7860
4. Stop services: `docker compose down`

## Changelog
- 2024-03-09: Initial setup with Docker Compose, PostgreSQL, and custom components support
- 2024-03-09: Updated commands to use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose` for compatibility with newer Docker versions
